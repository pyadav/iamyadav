# Hyperlist

Hyperlist started as a weekend experiment to make Hacker News feel less like a
screenshot from 2007 and more like a studio monitor. The interface is split into
three lightweight panes that can be rearranged with a keyboard shortcut. I wrote
custom parsers for HN threads so I could progressively stream comments and mark
responses that mention the author.

## Highlights

- Designed a typography system that keeps 30+ comments on screen without feeling
  cramped.
- Built an offline worker that mirrors saved stories to IndexedDB with background
  refresh intervals.
- Added a subtle audio cue when new replies land so I can keep coding with the
  tab in the background.
