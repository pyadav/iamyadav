# Stackfolio

Stackfolio is a living document of my favorite app flows. Each teardown is an
MDX note that mixes screenshots, annotations, and implementation details.
Instead of posting to social media, I keep everything together so I can link to
a single canonical source when someone asks how I think about a pattern.

## What I document

1. The first five minutes of a product experience.
2. The way typography, spacing, and iconography drive focus.
3. The tiny flourishes that make a surface feel intentional.

## Why it exists

When mentoring designers and engineers, it's easier to point at a real example
than talk in theory. Stackfolio gives me those references instantly, and it also
pushes me to keep my own craft sharp.
