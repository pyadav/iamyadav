Missing stack is a curated discovery platform that helps developers, founders, and early-stage teams find the best tools to build and grow products. Instead of sorting through thousands of SaaS options, Missing stack gives you fast, confident decisions through curated picks, comparisons, real-world stacks, and expert recommendations.

The goal: **reduce noise, increase clarity, and help teams pick the right tools without wasting time or money.**

## Highlights

- Curated directory of 20+ categories covering devtools, AI, design, marketing, operations, and no-code  
- Side-by-side tool comparisons (e.g., *Supabase vs Firebase*)  
- Ready-made “Startup Stacks” for different budgets and needs  
- Real founder workflows, reviews, and toolkits  
- Discounts and deals on popular SaaS tools  
- AI-powered stack recommendation engine (upcoming)

## Problem

Founders and developers waste time choosing tools because the SaaS ecosystem is huge and confusing:

- 20,000+ tools globally  
- Bloated pricing pages and hidden limitations  
- Too many broad or unorganized directories  
- Hard to know what’s actually “best” for your use case  
- Easy to overspend on tools you don’t need  

Startups want **speed**, **clarity**, and **confidence**.
