# Founder Fridays notes

Every Friday morning I host office hours for friends who are building software
companies. Over time the chats started to repeat, so I wrote down the prompts I
lean on. The post covers how I structure the call, which metrics matter when,
and the handful of red flags that show up over and over.

## Agenda template

1. What changed since last week?
2. Who did you talk to?
3. What can we decide right now?

Simple scripts like this keep the meetings short and the energy high.
